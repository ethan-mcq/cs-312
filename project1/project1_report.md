[20 points] Explain the time and space complexity of your RSA algorithm by showing and summing up the complexity of each subsection of your code. This must appear as a subsection of your report (that is, it is great to have this info in your code comments, but you should also pull it out and include it in the report proper). For this project all time and space complexities should be in terms of bits. In particular you need to explain your time and space complexity for:

    Modular Exponentiation
    Fermat for testing if a number is prime
    Miller-Rabin for testing if a number is prime
    Extended Euclid for finding a multiplicative inverse
    Generating a random prime number
    The full RSA algorithm to generate key pairs (the used combination of all of the above)

[10 points] Discuss the equations you used to compute the probability
of correctness for both your Fermat and Miller-Rabin implementations.
